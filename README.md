# Network Configuration Project

This project involves configuring a network topology based on the given layout. The tasks include IP address allocation using VLSM, configuring various routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP), implementing redistribution between these protocols, setting up DHCP, implementing NAT, and applying access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access.

## Configuration Steps

### 1. IP Address Allocation

- **VLSM Tree**: Utilized Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) to allocate IP addresses efficiently based on network requirements.
- **IP Address File**: The file "IP address" was used for specific IP address allocations.

### 2. Number of Required Hosts per Subnet

- Each network was assigned a different number of required hosts per subnet based on the VLSM tree.

### 3. Routing Protocols

- **First Block**: Configured OSPF with Area 1 for routing.
- **Second Block**: Implemented EIGRP 11 as the routing protocol.
- **Third Block - First Row**: Employed RIP for routing.
- **Second Row - First Block**: Implemented RIP for routing.
- **Second Row - Last Block**: Configured OSPF with Area 2 for routing.

### 4. Redistribution

- Redistribution was set up on Router 1, Router 2, Router 3, and Router 4 to connect EIGRP with OSPF, OSPF with RIP, and EIGRP with RIP. Router 4 was also configured for OSPF Area 1 to OSPF Area 2 redistribution.

### 5. DHCP

- **First Row - EIGRP, OSPF Area 1, RIP**: Hosts obtained IP addresses from DHCP 1 in the Second Block.
- **Second Row - OSPF Area 2 and RIP**: Hosts obtained IP addresses from DHCP 1 in the OSPF Area 2 Block.

### 6. VLSM Usage

- Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) was utilized in each network of the topology to optimize IP address usage.

### 7. NAT Implementation

- **Router 10**: Network G was configured for NAT using the provided Private IP Address.

### 8. Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- Access Control Lists (ACLs) were used to restrict specific hosts' access:
  - Network L: One PC is restricted from accessing the Web server.
  - Network E (1st Block): One PC is restricted from accessing the Data server.
  - Network A: All hosts are restricted from accessing the TFTP Server.

## Restrictions

### 9. Network Access Restrictions

- **Network L**: One PC with IP address [Specify IP] is restricted from accessing the Web server.
- **Network E (1st Block)**: One PC with IP address [Specify IP] is restricted from accessing the Data server.
- **Network A**: All hosts are restricted from accessing the TFTP Server.

### 10. Server Configuration

- TFTP, Web, and Data servers do not need running services; they are treated as hosts.

## Conclusion

The network configuration project successfully implemented VLSM, routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP), redistribution, DHCP, NAT, and access control lists. The described configuration provides an efficient and secure network infrastructure.
